# Gaussian Processes
Deriving an efficient method for GPO.

Now done! Try:
```
optimiser = GPOptimiser(rosenbrock_function,2)
optimiser.optimise(verbose=True)
```

## Todo
- Compare to someone else's implementation to check for any bugs
- Compare to gradient descent
- Pretty graphs of learning curve, maybe
- Gradient-based smoothness priors using JAX
